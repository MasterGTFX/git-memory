## Key Technical Decisions

### **1. Instructor + Pydantic for Structured AI Output**
- **Rationale**: Ensures reliable, type-safe AI responses
- **Benefits**: Reduces parsing errors, enables validation, improves maintainability
- **Trade-offs**: Adds complexity but significantly improves reliability

### **2. Multi-Provider AI Architecture**
- **Rationale**: Flexibility for different cost/performance requirements
- **Benefits**: OpenAI for quality, OpenRouter for alternatives, local for privacy
- **Implementation**: Abstract client factory with provider-specific configuration

### **3. Chronological Commit Processing**
- **Rationale**: Builds accurate incremental history understanding
- **Benefits**: Context preservation, proper evolution tracking
- **Challenge**: Handles initial commits and empty repository edge cases

### **4. Rich CLI with Progress Tracking**
- **Rationale**: Professional user experience for potentially long-running operations
- **Benefits**: User feedback, cost visibility, error communication
- **Implementation**: Typer + Rich for modern CLI aesthetics

### **5. Comprehensive Testing Strategy**
- **Rationale**: Reliability is critical for developer tools
- **Coverage**: 80% minimum with both unit and integration tests
- **Philosophy**: Test behavior, not implementation details
