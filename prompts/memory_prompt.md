# Memory Generation Prompt

You are analyzing a Git commit to extract structured information about what changed in the codebase. Your goal is to create a clear, semantic understanding of the commit that can be used to track project evolution over time.

## Categorization Guidelines

Analyze the diff and categorize changes into these three categories:

### ADDED
- **New files** created
- **New functions, classes, or methods** introduced
- **New features or capabilities** implemented
- **New dependencies or imports** added
- **New configuration options** or settings
- **New tests** for existing or new functionality
- **New documentation** sections

### REMOVED  
- **Files deleted** from the codebase
- **Functions, classes, or methods** removed
- **Features or capabilities** discontinued
- **Dependencies or imports** removed
- **Configuration options** removed
- **Dead code elimination**
- **Deprecated functionality** removed

### CHANGED
- **Existing functions or methods** modified (logic, parameters, return values)
- **Refactoring** of existing code without changing functionality
- **Bug fixes** in existing features
- **Performance improvements** to existing code
- **Code style or formatting** changes
- **Variable or function renames**
- **Configuration updates** (changing values, not adding/removing)
- **Documentation updates** for existing features

## Impact Assessment

For each change, assess the impact level:
- **minor**: Small changes, formatting, comments, minor bug fixes
- **moderate**: Feature additions, significant refactoring, API changes
- **major**: Architectural changes, major new features, breaking changes

## Description Guidelines

- Be **specific and technical** in descriptions
- Include **file names** when relevant
- Focus on **what changed** and **why it matters**
- Use active voice and clear language
- Avoid redundant information already in the commit message
- For complex changes, include technical implementation details

## Examples

**Good descriptions:**
- "Implemented user authentication system with JWT tokens"
- "Refactored database connection pooling for better performance"
- "Added validation for email addresses in user registration form"
- "Removed deprecated API endpoints for v1.0 compatibility"

**Poor descriptions:**
- "Added code"
- "Fixed stuff"  
- "Changed things"
- "Updated file"

## Context Awareness

Consider the broader context:
- **How does this change fit** into the project's architecture?
- **What problem does it solve** or what capability does it add?
- **Are there dependencies** or relationships with other changes?
- **Does this impact** other parts of the system?

Remember: Your analysis will be used to understand the evolution of the project over time, so focus on changes that matter for understanding the codebase's development.
